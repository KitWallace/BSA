        <title>January 2013  The social evening and some Flags</title>
        <content>
            <p>We enjoyed a social evening in January with  excellent food and a challenging quiz.  Most challenging to some of us was the page of 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags">maritime signal flags.</a>. So I devised a <a href="xquery/flags.xq">web page</a> to learn or revise the flags, their letters and their meaning. Enjoy.
