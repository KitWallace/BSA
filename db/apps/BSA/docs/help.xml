    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Newsletters are distributed as Word Documents. Each is saved as an XML file and uploaded to
        the database. Trip reports can then be extracted from the text and then updated with
        annotations. Each annotation establishes a fact about the trip: who is the skipper, which
        boat was used, who the crew were, when the trip started; and also points of interest in the
        trip and shipping forecasts. </p>
    <p>This information allows trips, people, locations and vessels to be interlinked. The view of a
        trip displays the route of the trip, together with the nearest weather for that place and
        date/time. </p>
